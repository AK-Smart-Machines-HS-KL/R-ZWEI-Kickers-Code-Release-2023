# R-ZWEI-Kickers-Code-Release-2023
This is the 2023 code release of the RoboCup-SPL team R-ZWEI Kickers. This README-file shortly illustrates the structure of our codebase.

## B-Human Code Release

Since our team is still very new in the league and our numbers are pretty small we didn't start everything from scratch. Our code is based on the official 2021 B-Human code release. Documentation for it can be found in their [public wiki](https://wiki.b-human.de/coderelease2021/).

Previous of their code releases are tagged with "coderelease&lt;year&gt;", where &lt;year&gt; is the year in which the code was released (starting with 2013).

Please note that **before** you clone this repository on Windows, execute:
```
git config --global core.autocrlf input
git config --global core.eol lf
```

As this repository uses submodules, it must be cloned using `git clone --recursive`. Downloading the release as `zip` or `tar.gz` does not work.
